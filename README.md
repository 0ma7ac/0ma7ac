👋 Hi, I’m Omar Ahmed Abdi (@0ma7ac)
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a final-year Computer Science student at Riara University, passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and software development. I love tackling real-world challenges through code, whether it’s securing networks, building tools, or exploring new tech.

👀 I’m Interested In...
Cybersecurity: Penetration testing, network security, and OSINT to make systems safer.
Software Development: Writing clean, efficient code in Python, Rust, and Dart.
Innovation: Creating tools that solve practical problems, from web scraping to secure secret sharing.
Learning: Staying ahead in the fast-evolving world of tech and security.
🌱 I’m Currently Learning...
Advanced penetration testing techniques with Kali Linux, Burp Suite, and Metasploit.
Rust for building secure, high-performance applications (currently on my 100 Days of Code journey!).
Preparing for ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) and exploring CCNA certification.
Deepening my knowledge of web security and vulnerability assessment.
💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On...
Open-source cybersecurity projects, like tools for ethical hacking or network analysis.
Software development projects in Python, Rust, or Dart—especially those with real-world impact.
Innovative ideas that blend security and usability, like secure file-sharing or password management tools.
